				<h3>Q:How late do you take calls?</h3>

				<p>A:nothing past 9pm please</p>

				<h3>Q:How much do you charge per walk??</h3>

				<h3>Q:Are the dogs walked in groups or alone?</h3>

				<p>A:We generally walk them in groups of 3-5</p>

				<h3>Q:My dog does not get along with other dogs, but still needs to be walked. What are my options?</h3>
